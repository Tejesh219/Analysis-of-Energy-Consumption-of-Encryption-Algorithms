# Analysis-of-Energy-Consumption-of-Encryption-Algorithms
This project aims to analyze the energy efficiency of three different encryption algorithms: Advanced Encryption Standard, Data Encryption Standard and Triple Data Encryption Standard. A Raspberry Pi will be used to run the codes and measure the energy consumption. The results will be plotted as a graph.
